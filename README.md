# GTU cse241 - Object Oriented Programming 

## Principles of OOP

1. Encapsulation

* Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.

2. Abstraction

* Hide internal implementation details within ADT or class.

3. Inheritance

* Inheritances expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two objects. Using Inheritance, In derived classes we can reuse the code of existing super classes. In Java, concept of “is-a” is based on class inheritance (using extends) or interface implementation (using implements).

4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many shapes” in Greek. It means one name many forms. It is further of two types — static and dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding. It is closely related to inheritance. We can write a code that works on the superclass, and it will work with any subclass type as well by overriding.
